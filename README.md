Part A 
   2) We have downloaded netserv.c and netclient.c from the link provided and after understanding the code we runned them in different terminals in ubuntu. When we run netserv.c it says "Server is alive and waiting for socket connection from client" and on another terminal when we run netclient.c it says "Client is alive and establishing socket connection" for a while and then say " Error establishing communications: connection refused" that means the connection between client and server couldn't be established (they couldn't connect). This is because of the ip address that is provided in netclient '132.161.33.175'
  5) After getting the copmuter ip address and replace the previous one by the computer ip (132.161.33.175 -> 127.0.0.1) when we recompile netclient.c and run both the server will be alive and creats a socket and will wait for socket connection and waits for a client to contact it.  if that is successful it will write for socket form 1 - 10 then exit similarly in the client side will receive 1-10 from socket finally will exit. Server and client have succesfully connected.The socket works as IPC
 6) When we run only the client it will first be alive and try to establish connection but since the server is not alive this connection will be refused.
